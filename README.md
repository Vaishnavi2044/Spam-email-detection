# Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project detects whether an email/message is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The model analyzes text messages, processes them using TF-IDF vectorization, and classifies them using machine learning algorithms.
